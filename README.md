# Professional activity
## 1) [FAST_NEWS_AI](https://github.com/1NT9NS9/fast-news-ai.git)
- Don't have time to read all your Telegram channels?
- Tired of reading the same news in different channels?
- Is information noise making you anxious?
I read all your channels to find and combine repeated stories. No more duplicates!
You read less and learn more. You receive only unique and important information.

## 3) Finance / cryptocurrency [ROADPROFIT](https://t.me/ROADPROFIT) 
- 3.1 Founder of the telegram channel
- 3.2 BTC price prediction using the XGBoost model;
- parsing / analysis / visualization / data cleaning / conversion / data merging;
- model selection / preparing data for the model / data splitting / model training;
- prediction / metrics / visualization of results / saving the model and metadata / conclusions;
- results: the number of profitable / unprofitable transactions 60/40% (at the time of work on the project 05.2025).
- 4.3 Development of scripts to optimize work processes in the field of cryptocurrencies:
- airdrop - receiving project tokens as a reward. Average yield of 1000%;
- memes - finding promising projects. Average yield of 500%.

## 4) [Machine learning projects](https://github.com/1NT9NS9/1NT9NS9/blob/main/README(finance).md)

## 5) [Video AI](https://github.com/1NT9NS9/telegram_video_bot)
The offers 5 distinct video generation modes and supports 10 languages:
- Text to Video - Generate videos from text descriptions only
- Text + Image to Video - Create videos using a text prompt and a single reference image
- Text + First/Last Image - Generate videos with defined start and end frames
