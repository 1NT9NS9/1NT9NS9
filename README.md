# Professional activity

## 1)Finance / AI (field of activity)
1. ["Financial consultant based on AI"](https://finance-ai.cloud) (My product*)
- the user gets the opportunity to create an individual financial portfolio based on his preferences;
- the user gets the opportunity to see the transactions of the project portfolios;
- the user gets the opportunity to communicate with the financial assistant based on AI;
- the user gets the opportunity to copy the transactions of profitable portfolios by subscription.

## 2)Finance / cryptocurrency (field of activity)
- 2.1 Founder of the telegram channel [ROADPROFIT](https://t.me/ROADPROFIT) (My product*)
- 2.2 BTC price prediction using the XGBoost model;
- parsing / analysis / visualization / data cleaning / conversion / data merging;
- model selection / preparing data for the model / data splitting / model training;
- prediction / metrics / visualization of results / saving the model and metadata / conclusions;
- results: the number of profitable / unprofitable transactions 60/40% (at the time of work on the project 05.2025).
- 2.3 Development of scripts to optimize work processes in the field of cryptocurrencies:
- airdrop - receiving project tokens as a reward. Average yield of 1000%;
- memes - finding promising projects. Average yield of 500%.

## 3)Construction (field of activity)
