# Professional activity
## 1)News flow
[@superfast_news_bot](https://t.me/superfast_news_bot)
- Don't have time to read all your Telegram channels?
- Tired of reading the same news in different channels?
- Is information noise making you anxious?
I read all your channels to find and combine repeated stories. No more duplicates!
You read less and learn more. You receive only unique and important information.

## 2)Finance / AI 
2. ["Financial consultant based on AI"](https://finance-ai.cloud) (My product*)
- the user gets the opportunity to create an individual financial portfolio based on his preferences;
- the user gets the opportunity to see the transactions of the project portfolios;
- the user gets the opportunity to communicate with the financial assistant based on AI;
- the user gets the opportunity to copy the transactions of profitable portfolios by subscription.

## 3)Finance / cryptocurrency 
- 3.1 Founder of the telegram channel [ROADPROFIT](https://t.me/ROADPROFIT) (My product*)
- 3.2 BTC price prediction using the XGBoost model;
- parsing / analysis / visualization / data cleaning / conversion / data merging;
- model selection / preparing data for the model / data splitting / model training;
- prediction / metrics / visualization of results / saving the model and metadata / conclusions;
- results: the number of profitable / unprofitable transactions 60/40% (at the time of work on the project 05.2025).
- 4.3 Development of scripts to optimize work processes in the field of cryptocurrencies:
- airdrop - receiving project tokens as a reward. Average yield of 1000%;
- memes - finding promising projects. Average yield of 500%.

## 4)Video
The [app](https://github.com/1NT9NS9/telegram_bot_video/blob/main/README.md) offers 5 distinct video generation modes and supports 10 languages:
- Text to Video - Generate videos from text descriptions only
- Text + Image to Video - Create videos using a text prompt and a single reference image
- Text + First/Last Image - Generate videos with defined start and end frames
- Text + Reference Images - Use separate asset and style reference images (1-3 of each) for more controlled generation
- Text + Video Extension - Extend existing videos with new content based on text descriptions

## 5)Construction 
- Forecasting the demand for building materials using the CatBoost model;
- loading / analysis / visualization / data cleaning / conversion / data merging;
- model selection / preparing data for the model / data splitting / training the model;
- prediction / metrics / visualization of results / saving the model and metadata / conclusions;
- results:
- reduction of "frozen" capital by 10%;
- reduction of warehouse space by 20%;
- reduction of downtime due to lack of materials by 10%;
- reduction of urgent deliveries by 15%.

## 6)Machine learning projects
- Developed asset-price prediction pipelines for stock and crypto markets with **XGBoost** and **LSTM**
see projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/1NT9NS9/1NT9NS9/blob/main/README(finance).md).
